## About the project

This repository contains the Frontend app for Karakata.
It is an idea that focuses on solving digital and online business owners day to day customer retention problems by using technology and automation (using the Artificial Intelligence model). 

#### The problem faced
The inability of business owners to easily reach and keep up with a wide range of customers concerning sales and product availability, unpaid invoices follow up, customer retention, 
estimating a customers lifetime value, custom kind of frequent communication to keep interaction between every old and new customers with the business activities. 

#### Solution
To have a web tool where sales and customer satisfaction are automated by using communication (starting with automated Whatsapp messaging). The app will be able to generate and send receipts 
and invoices to customers as at when due by making the sales process easy as well.

## Sign Your Commits

### DCO
Licensing is important to open source projects. It provides some assurances that
the software will continue to be available based under the terms that the
author(s) desired. We require that contributors sign off on commits submitted to
our project's repositories. The [Developer Certificate of Origin
(DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) is a way to certify that you wrote and
have the right to contribute the code you are submitting to the project.

You sign-off by adding the following to your commit messages. Your sign-off must
match the git user and email associated with the commit.

    This is my commit message

    Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.name@example.com>

Git has a `-s` command line option to do this automatically:

    git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'

If you forgot to do this and have not yet pushed your changes to the remote
repository, you can amend your commit with the sign-off by running 

    git commit --amend -s 

## Pull Request Checklist

When you submit your pull request, or you push new commits to it, our automated
systems will run some checks on your new code. We require that your pull request
passes these checks, but we also have more criteria than just that before we can
accept and merge it. We recommend that you check the following things locally
before you submit your code:

* It passes tests: run the following command to run all of the tests locally:
  
  ```
  npm run test
  ```

  ```
  npm run lint
  ```
* Impacted code has new or updated tests
* Documentation created/updated
* We use `GitHub Actions`  to test all pull requests. We require that all tests succeed on a pull request before it is merged.
* Follows all the code standards required.
